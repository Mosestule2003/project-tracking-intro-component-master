## My process

- This project is comprised of five sections;
 1. Page-container
 - I started off by breaking down the required components.
 - Setting up the tools needed for the project followed.
 - In each section, I made use of custom names to best describe the type of content found in each container. eg(flex-container, grid-container).
- Mobile-first workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Useful resources

- [](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me to understand fully how position absolute works. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
